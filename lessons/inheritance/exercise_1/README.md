# Exercise 1
## 1. Instructions

Two class files have been created for you - `Rectangle` and `Shape`. However, there is no code inside those classes. However, there are tests that describe how each class should function.

Your job is to write code that makes each test pass.

Suggested order:
```
rectangle_spec.rb -> rectangle.rb
shape_spec.rb -> shape.rb
```

## 2. Refactoring Using Inheritance
After your `Rectangle` and `Shape` tests are passing, refactor the `Rectangle` class to use inheritance, with the `Shape` as the parent.

When refactoring, still follow TDD - but you will need to decide if you need to write any new tests or not! Read the existing tests & functionalities carefully before writing new tests.
For example, to test for inheritance, you should write a test that uses the `is_a?` method. A test that asks if `Rectangle is_a? Shape` should pass after successfully implementing inheritance.

Decide if there are other ways to test for inheritance. If you want to make new methods on a class to prove this, go for it! No guidelines here, it should just still make sense for the objects you're designing.

## 3. More shapes!
After you've refactored to use inheritance and all your tests are still passing, use TDD to create a new `Circle` test and class with the following attributes:

```
:color
:radius

# Methods
circumference #(2 (pi * r))
```

### 4. Refactoring with Inheritance
After your `Circle` tests are passing, refactor it to inherit from the `Shape` class.

#### Keep in mind...
Some questions to answer before starting:
- Does a `Circle` need to be able to use `area` and `perimeter`?
// No

- Are there any methods or attributes you created in `Circle` that can be moved "up" to `Shape`? Why or why not?
// None, as radius isn't applicable to every shape. Same goes for the methods circumference and updated area. 

- Does using inheritance make sense in this example? Why/Why not?
// Probably not as we don't use any parent variables (besides color, thats negligible)
